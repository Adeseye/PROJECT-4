# PROJECT-4
In this project I will be deploying MEAN stack on to Ubuntu server

MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:
MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows to retrieve data.
Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user
